But my perspective was knowing more about Jesus, not getting to know Him better. I had no idea what God&rsquo;s Spirit had in store for me as I studied. With each name, my understanding of Jesus&rsquo; character and roles grew, but even more, the understanding of His work in my life.</p>

								<h4><a href="#">Fight For Us</a></h4>
								<p>I love Rachel&rsquo;s writing. Even though I&rsquo;m in a different season of life, her insights seem to apply across the board. Read her latest piece on fighting for the body of Christ during your trials and sufferings.</p>
								<h4><a href="#">The &ldquo;Well, Maybe . . .&rdquo; of the Old Testatment</a></h4>
								<p>If you&rsquo;re making your way through the Old Testament right now, this rundown will serve as a breath of fresh air to keep you going and will make you eager for Jesus to come on the scene in the New Testament.</p>
